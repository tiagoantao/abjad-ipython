abjad-ipython
=============

A ipython notebook extension to interact with abjad.

Caveat: The current version was tested only on Python 3.4. If you have problems with previous versions, please do contact me

Requirements
------------

1. abjad (!)
2. ipython notebook (!). Version 2.0
3. lilypond (required by abjad)
4. wand (Python ImageMagick library)
5. configobj
6. ply

Get abjad from github. On ubuntu, the default ipython is not enough, get 2.0 (from github, pip or conda).

The default lilypond version of the latest ubuntu is not enough. You need at least 2.17

apt-get python3-wand python3-ply

configobj: pip3 install configobj --user


The examples
------------

A few examples are provided, there were taken from abjad documentation. I am not the author of them (other than the conversion to notebooks)
